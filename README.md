# Gold-Rush
I ammended the layout/theme of this game to add a more personal spin on this.
<br /> 

Rules to "Gold Rush"

There are 3 metal bars displayed as buttons on the page.
<br />
The Player will be shown a random 'Total Price' at the start of the game.
<br />
When the player clicks on a metal bar, it will add value amount to the 'Current Bank'.
<br />
The value of the metal bar is unknown until the Player clicks on the metal bar.
<br />
The Player wins if their 'Current Bank' match the 'Total Price'.
